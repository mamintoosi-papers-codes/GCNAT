#GCNAT: A Graph-Based Deep Learning Algorithm for Predicting Disease-Metabolite Associations

File Description:
1. newdata.csv : disease-metabolite associations. According to the HMDB, if the metabolite is associated with disease, its label will be 1. Otherwise, the label will be 0.
2. GM2.csv : Gaussian kernel similarity of metabolites.
3. DSS.csv: Integrative Similarity of diseases.
